Todo:
  ☐ Consider some control charts
  - AMCUSUM
  - LLCUSUM
  - LI2012
  DFEWMA:
    ☐ Read paper
    ☐ Implement control chart
    ☐ Generate data according to functional form
  Comparison:
    Tuning parameters:
      ☐ Use the same control charts as above
      nsims = 1000:
        ☐ Run classical bisection
        ☐ Run approximate bisection with m ∈ {100, 250, 500, 1000, 5000}
      nsims = 10000:
        ☐ Run classical bisection
        ☐ Run approximate bisection with m ∈ {1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 50000}
      ☐ Compare results in terms of optimized function (NOT THE ATTAINED ARL0)
    Multiple charts:
      ☐ Comparison with saCL
      ☐ Run multiple LLCUSUM
      ☐ Run multiple LI2012
